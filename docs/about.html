                <p>This application is intended for users to throw ideas on their sticky notes, represented by the 
                    amount of notes. The user can add bullet points as well. There're some hiccups, particularly
                    the inability for the user to select anywhere on the text, except within the words, to select 
                    and continue writing. If the user has an account and logs in, the user can save the notes, 
                    granted that it's saved to the local storage and the default location is at the downloads
                    file.
