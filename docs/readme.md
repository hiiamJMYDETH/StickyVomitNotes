# Sticky Vomit Journals

# Update: Sticky Vomit Notes no longer accepts login requests so all 
# accounts registered on it are lost. There are no attempts to recover
# any of them. However, the developer is working on making a new database
# to accept accounts at this time. 

Sticky Vomit Journals is a simple notetaking app designed for word vommitters and allows local and cloud saving. 

To get started, make a new note and start writing. If you make an account, you can save files both locally and on the cloud.
